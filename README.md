# DATA_ANALYSIS-
## What is data analysis ?
-Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to uncover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It involves a variety of techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights from raw data. The primary goal of data analysis is to discover patterns, trends, correlations, and other relevant information that can aid in understanding a phenomenon or making informed decisions.
## Key step for data analysis process.
*Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources. This could involve surveys, experiments, sensors, databases, or other means of data collection.

*Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the data through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and other methods to understand its characteristics and identify potential patterns or relationships.

*Data Modeling: Applying statistical or machine learning models to the data to make predictions, classify information, or identify trends. This step involves selecting appropriate models and algorithms based on the nature of the data and the analysis goals.

*Interpretation of Results: Analyzing the output of models and statistical tests to draw meaningful conclusions. This may involve making predictions, identifying patterns, or gaining insights into the underlying processes.

Visualization and Communication: Presenting the findings in a clear and understandable way through charts, graphs, reports, or other visualizations. Effective communication of results is essential for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Validation and Iteration: Checking the reliability of the analysis by validating the results using additional data or alternative methods. The process may be iterated to refine the analysis and improve its accuracy.
